MBE20_TILEENTITY_DATA

This is an example of how you can use a TileEntity to store extra information about a block.
In this case, it stores a timer value.  When the block is placed, the timer starts counting down.  When the timer
  reaches zero, the block randomly changes into something else.

This example will show you
1) how to create a Block class with an associated TileEntity
2) how to create a TileEntity class and register it
3) how to save and load the state of the TileEntity using NBT: writeToNBT() and readFromNBT()
4) an overview of how to use NBT for a variety of different data types
5) how to send the server TileEntity information to the client using packets: getDescriptionPacket() and onDataPacket()
6) how to get your TileEntity updated every tick: implementing IUpdatePlayerListBox

The pieces you need to understand are located in:
Startup
BlockTileEntityData
TileEntityData

Various other resources associated with the block rendering (see mbe01 for more details) are located in
resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\lang\en_US.lang
resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\blockstates\
resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\models\block\
resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\textures\blocks\
resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\models\item\

The block will appear in the Blocks tab in the creative inventory.

Further information:
NBTexplorer is a very useful tool to examine the structure of your NBT saved data and make sure it's correct:

--------
Common errors:
TileEntity doesn't properly restore after loading a saved game - your NBT read/write code is wrong / mismatched. Did you
  forget the super.writeToNBT() and/or super.readFromNBT()?
The TileEntity on the client doesn't synchronise properly  - getDescriptionPacket() and onDataPacket() may be wrong
"{your tileentity class} is missing a mapping! This is a bug!" - you forgot to GameRegistry.registerTileEntity()
