 * BlockPartial uses a model which doesn't occupy the entire 1x1x1m space, and is made up of two pieces.
 * We can walk over it without colliding.
 * For background information on blocks see here http://greyminecraftcoder.blogspot.com.au/2014/12/blocks-18.html
 * For a couple of the methods below the Forge guys have marked it as deprecated.  But you still need to override those
 *   "deprecated" block methods.  What they mean is "when you want to find out if a block is (eg) isOpaqueCube(),
 *   don't call block.isOpaqueCube(), call iBlockState.isOpaqueCube() instead".
 * If that doesn't make sense to you yet, don't worry.  Just ignore the "deprecated method" warning.
