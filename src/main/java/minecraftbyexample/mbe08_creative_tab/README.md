# MBE08_CREATIVE_TAB

Code by Nephroid

This example adds two "creative tabs" to the vanilla tabs:

1. an ordinary tab which uses the Item / Blocks `.setCreativeTab()`
1. an 'advanced' tab which displays all items and blocks belonging to this mod, by looking at the item/block name

It will show you how to add a creative tab for organising your custom blocks and items.

The pieces you need to understand are located in:

* `StartupCommon`
* `AllMbeItemsTab`
* `resources\assets\minecraftbyexample\lang\en_US.lang` -- for the displayed name of the tabs

The example also uses some files in `resources\assets\minecraftbyexample` to draw the test block and item, these aren't relevant to the example. See examples 1-3 and 10-12.
