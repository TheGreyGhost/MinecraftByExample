		Some (sadly breaking) improvements to the Fluid API (#6110)
		* Some (sadly breaking) improvements to the API, after feedback and
		concerns provided by users:
		 - Moved calculation of the translation key to the FluidAttributes
		constructor, so that builders can be shared between still & flowing
		sub-fluids.
		 - Moved biome-based coloring to a dedicated FluidAttributes.Water
		variant, which is not used by default.
		 - Added logic to automatically gather fluid textures into the list of
		textures to bake.
		 - Patched BucketItem and FlowingFluidBlock to avoid eager access to the
		fluid objects.
		 - Added a ForgeFlowingFluid class, as a more user-friendly way to
		construct a new FlowingFluid.
