		Move the "modloading" thread activity onto _our_ worker pool. It turns out that the vanilla worker pool can deadlock during stitching if it's insufficiently large, if modloader "waitForTransition" is also a worker member of that pool.
		
		Closes #7293 (to reproduce issue easily, modify Util.func_240979_a_ and change the values in the MathHelper.clamp call). I've verified that 3 and below for "max" cause the problem. (I didn't test a whole range of values, just sufficient to reproduce problem and verify fix). Note that setting it to zero (and using the "direct executor" that's inaccessible in normal operation) works as well with this fix.

		Clarify in the LazyOptional which methods carry the lazyness over to the returned value and which don't. (#6750)
		
		For consistency, this meant making a few changes:
		- Renamed the existing lazy mapping method to lazyMap, to indicate that it doesn't run the mapping immediately.
		- Added a new implementation of map(), which returns Optional<T>, and resolves the value in the process.
		- Changed filter() to return Optional, since there's no way to filter lazily.
		- Added a new method resolve(), which helps convert the custom LazyOptional class into a standard Optional, for use
		with library methods that expect Optional<T>.
		
		* Update License headers.

		Reorganize modloading on the dediserver. This removes the DedicatedServer parameter from the FMLDedicatedServerSetupEvent.
		Code for customizing the server instance should be moved to the ServerAboutToStartEvent or similar, where the server instance
		is available.
		
		This reorganization means that mods will load fully before the server is even constructed, or the server properties loaded. We also move the EULA right to the front so we don't have to wait for bootstrap.
		
		This should fix the problems with mods which customize world data and other things.
